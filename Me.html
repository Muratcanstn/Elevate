                to understand why I wanted to leave physics after
                five years in order to do something completely different.
                Several books have helped me find answers to my questions.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I have now managed to answer all of them and,

                varied that I thought this was a problem a few months ago.
                However, I knew that my passion for music,
                drawing, design, cinema, photography, philosophy and psychology would
                not help me in my academic career as a physicist. Indeed, I have
                studied science and in particular physics for the last five years.
                Today, and for several reasons that I will explain later,
                I am looking for renewal.

            <div class="text4"> The decision I made may seem incoherent,<br/> insane or even idyllic.
                Some will say that it is<br/> a shame to stop when I find myself so
                close to the goal. So I also made the decision to no longer care
                about the opinion of others. Wouldn't it be<br/> a shame living
                across the spectrum of other people thoughts ? <br/>
                <br/>
                Although my passion for physics and scientific research remains
                unchanged, it is with pleasure that I begin a new training in web
                development and web design in order to discover new horizons. I like to learn new
                things all the time because it is through knowledge that we can fight
                the fear of change. <br/>
                Thus, I gladly put my creativity at the disposal of my amateur
                works which reflect my personality and my universe.
                In 10 years time, I would like to found my web agency in order to help local businesses

            explains how a couple could reconnect by looking the
            reality of adultery in the face. It invites us to analyze
            its causes, all events that led to it and what need to be
            improved to avoid it in the future. Therefore, the purpose
            of this book isn't to endorse deception but to understand its
            causes to prevent them. Bringing an open mind and a more

                The world does not revolve around our singular person, and
                we are wrong to want to control what cannot be. Failure is
                often presented as being able to be overcome by simple perseverance,
                by a power of will. And the feeling of cowardice invades us when we
                let go of a situation that makes us suffer. However, all this amounts
                to forgetting that one of the virtues of failure is to remind us that
                our power over reality is limited. The famous quote "when you want,
                you can" then seems to be an absurdity as well as an insult to the
                complexity of the reality. The narcissism that emanates
                from this sentence makes us all more unhappy when a situation escapes us, and it
                leads to a pejorative judgment, devoid of objectivity, a depreciation that
                brings deep sadness. It is then important to take the necessary step
                back to better undertake a task or a mission. Questioning and knowing
                how to live are essential, especially when we meet people and an
                environment that is unfamiliar to us.

            transcribe my universe through my creations and my texts. Aware that
            I still have a lot to learn, I am convinced that my hard work will pay off.
